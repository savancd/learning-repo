# Self Learning Development

This is a self-directed learning course.

The purpose of this course is to get knowledgeable and qualified to work as a Full Stack Software Developer(junior) within a year.

This repository was created so that I could access it and work from anywhere. 

## Little about myself 

After many years of working in the creative sector as a photographer and 3D artist at VFX studios.

I'm starting my re-education in programming with the goal of eventually becoming a full-stack software engineer in a year.
