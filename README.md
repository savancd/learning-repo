# Self Learning Development

This is a self-directed learning progress/process.
This repository was created so that I could access it and work from anywhere.

This is mashup of a lot of projects that I used in my self learning process.

## These projects are primarily not of my own design, but rather a culmination of various tutorials that I utilized during my journey to learn coding. Most of these tutorials can be found on YouTube and other online sources.

## This Learning repo is not intented to be fully functional website or project, all is made to be a collection of notes to myself where I can always go back and re-remember how to do some stuff.

## Little about myself 

After many years of working in the creative industry as a photographer and 3D artist at VFX studio.

I'm starting my re-education into programming with the goal to learn something new and push my mind in order to improve and broaden my knowledge and to be able to do work as Full Stack Software Developer in a year.
