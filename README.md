This is mashup of a lot of projects that I used in my self learning process.

## Most of these projects are primarily not my own design, but rather a culmination of various tutorials that I utilized during my journey to learn coding. Most of these tutorials can be found on YouTube and other online sources.

## Little about myself 

I am 3D Artist who work in industry since 2020. I have interest and I like programing, with all this projects & excercises I am trying to learn something new & to extend my knowledge. My goal is mainly to learn Python and Linux, from that I'm gonna try to extend more my knowledge and to learn more programing languages that would benefit my career and opportunity to work more as a remote worker.
