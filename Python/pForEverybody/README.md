> ####  Constants
>> - Fixed values such as numbers, letters, and strings, are called "constants" because their value does not change
>
>> - Numeric **constants** are as you expect
>
>> - String **constants** use single quotes (') or double quotes (")
>
> ####  Variables
>> - A **variable** is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the **variable** "name"
>
>> - Programmers get to choose the names of the **variables**
>
>> - You can change the contents of a **variable** in a later statenment
>
> #### Python Variable Name rules
>
>> - Must start with a letter or underscore _
>
>> - Must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores
>
>> - Case Sensitive
>
>> **Good:** spam eggs spam23 - use **_speed** only in specific cases and only if python told to use it as a **variable name**
>
>> **Bad:** 23spam #sign var.12
>
>> **Different:** spam Spam SPAM
>
> A variable is a memory location used to store a value. The value stored in a variable can be updated by replacing the old value (0.6) with a new value (0.93)
>
>> x = 3.9 * x * (1 - x)
>
>> 0.936
>
>> **The right side is an expression.** Once the expression is evaluated, the result is placed in (assigned to) the variable on the left side (i.e., x)

>> #### Expressions

| Numeric Expressions | Operator | Opeartion |
| Because of the lack of mathematical symbols on computer keyboards - we use "computer-speak" to express the classic math operations | + | Addition |
| Asterisk is miltiplication | - | Subtraction |
| Exponentiation (raise to a power) looks different than in math | * | Multiplication |
|   | / | Division |
|   | ** | Power |
