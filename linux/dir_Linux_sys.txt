Directory

/
 The root directory. Where everything begins.
/bin
 Contains binaries (programs) that must be present for the
system to boot and run.
/boot
 Contains the Linux kernel, initial RAM disk image (for
drivers needed at boot time), and the boot loader.
Interesting files:
● /boot/grub/grub.conf or menu.lst, which
are used to configure the boot loader.
● /boot/vmlinuz (or something similar), the Linux
kernel

This is a special directory that contains device nodes.
“Everything is a file” also applies to devices. Here is where
the kernel maintains a list of all the devices it understands.
The /etc directory contains all of the system-wide
configuration files. It also contains a collection of shell
scripts that start each of the system services at boot time.
Everything in this directory should be readable text.
Interesting files: While everything in /etc is interesting,
here are some all-time favorites:
● /etc/crontab, a file that defines when
automated jobs will run.
● /etc/fstab, a table of storage devices and their
associated mount points.
● /etc/passwd, a list of the user accounts.
In normal configurations, each user is given a directory in
/home. Ordinary users can only write files in their home
directories. This limitation protects the system from errant
user activity.
Contains shared library files used by the core system
programs. These are similar to dynamic link libraries
(DLLs) in Windows.
Each formatted partition or device using a Linux file system,
such as ext4, will have this directory. It is used in the case of
a partial recovery from a file system corruption event.
Unless something really bad has happened to our system,
this directory will remain empty.
On modern Linux systems the /media directory will
contain the mount points for removable media such as USB
drives, CD-ROMs, etc. that are mounted automatically at
insertion.
On older Linux systems, the /mnt directory contains mount
points for removable devices that have been mounted
manually.

The /opt directory is used to install “optional” software.
This is mainly used to hold commercial software products
that might be installed on the system.
The /proc directory is special. It's not a real file system in
the sense of files stored on the hard drive. Rather, it is a
virtual file system maintained by the Linux kernel. The
“files” it contains are peepholes into the kernel itself. The
files are readable and will give us a picture of how the
kernel sees the computer.
This is the home directory for the root account.
This directory contains “system” binaries. These are
programs that perform vital system tasks that are generally
reserved for the superuser.
The /tmp directory is intended for the storage of temporary,
transient files created by various programs. Some
configurations cause this directory to be emptied each time
the system is rebooted.
The /usr directory tree is likely the largest one on a Linux
system. It contains all the programs and support files used
by regular users.
/usr/bin contains the executable programs installed by
the Linux distribution. It is not uncommon for this directory
to hold thousands of programs.
The shared libraries for the programs in /usr/bin.
The /usr/local tree is where programs that are not
included with the distribution but are intended for system-
wide use are installed. Programs compiled from source code
are normally installed in /usr/local/bin. On a newly
installed Linux system, this tree exists, but it will be empty
until the system administrator puts something in it.
Contains more system administration programs.
/usr/share contains all the shared data used by
programs in /usr/bin. This includes things such as
default configuration files, icons, screen backgrounds, sound
files, etc.

Most packages installed on the system will include some
kind of documentation. In /usr/share/doc, we will find
documentation files organized by package.
With the exception of /tmp and /home, the directories we
have looked at so far remain relatively static, that is, their
contents don't change. The /var directory tree is where
data that is likely to change is stored. Various databases,
spool files, user mail, etc. are located here.
/var/log contains log files, records of various system
activity. These are important and should be monitored from
time to time. The most useful ones are
/var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog. Note
that for security reasons on some systems only the superuser
may view log files.
